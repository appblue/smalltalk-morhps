# Smalltalk Morhps
Simple animation example written in Pharo Smalltalk based on the Athens Flake Demo included in the system. Program is using `Morph` object to create a animated on screen object.

To start the animation in a window, open `Transcript` window and paste:

```smalltalk
MyMorph new openInWindow.
```
You should see new window with two squares (red and black) dancing :)

## Installation
Simplest way to install the code is to:
* create a new Package `KrisMorph`
* copy-paste `class` and `method` definitions from the `.smalltalk` file
